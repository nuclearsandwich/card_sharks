# go_fish.rb version 0.1

# initial setup for now; [important] stuff to remember for later:
	# players take turns asking for cards from one another
	# if a player has what the other asks for, the latter must turn over ALL cards of that RANK to the asking player
	# if a player gets what they ask for, they get another turn
	# if a player doesn't get what they ask for from another player, but get what they asked for from "going fishing,"
		# they get another turn - also, they must announce that they got what they asked for
	# a player CANNOT ask for something if THEY DO NOT have at least one of what they are asking for
	# when a player's hand contains all 4 suits of a RANK (King King King King), all of those cards are set aside
		# into a permanent score-pool for that player
	# player's score based on how many sets of 4 they have, via RANK (King King King King == a set)

	# list of things working properly:
		# player gets another turn if they got what they ask for, or on a do_you_have_any or a go_fish

	# list of things half-working:
		# they player cannot ask for something they don't have - but the program is not incrementing through hands properly -
			# either the player's or the dealer's - so it may not find something that they DO have.

	# list of thing to do/fix:
		# While testing the .gsub in dealers_turn:
			# Player hand: Eight of Diamonds, Ace of Diamonds, Three of Clubs, Nine of Clubs, Five of Spades, Queen of Spades, Ten of Clubs.
			# Dealer hand: Ace of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, Ace of Spades, Queen of Hearts, Nine of Diamonds, Six of Diamonds.
			# You get the first turn.
			# What rank do you want to ask your opponent for?
			# Ace
			# The dealer had a Ace; you add the Ace of Clubs to your hand.
			# What rank do you want to ask your opponent for?
				# The dealer had two Aces - Clubs and Spades - but the player was not given both, only one.
				# [Part of the] problem is, the program calls ask_for befoing finishing going through the entire hand
				# This may also have to do with why the program isn't finding a rank sometimes:
			# Ace
			# The dealer does not have any Aces. You go fish, instead.
			# You fish a Jack of Hearts from the pool.
				# The program isn't going far enough through the hand to find the rank.

		# Also, the .gsub doesn't quite work:
			# go_fish.rb:92:in `block in dealers_turn': undefined method `gsub' for Jack of Diamonds:Card (NoMethodError)
